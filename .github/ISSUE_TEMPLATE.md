Thanks for contributing!

Issues in swcarpentry/curriculum-advisors are intended as a place to discuss
open questions about how to structure SWC lessons and workshops.

Before you submit a new topic for discussion (open a new issue), please be sure
that you've done the following:

- [ ] Confirm that you are submitting a topic within the purview of the CAC See the ([Curriculum Advisory Committee Consultation Rubric](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/cac-consult-rubric.html).)
- [ ] Search past issues in this repository (both open and closed) to see if your discussion has already happened or is ongoing. Feel free to add your thoughts to these existing discussions instead of opening a new issue.
- [ ] Identify linkable sources for past discussions or relevant open issues in the swcarpentry lessons.
- [ ] Ideally: Consider the pros/cons of the changes you want to propose and provide these details in your submission.
- [ ] Ensure that your submission conforms to the Carpentries [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html).

The most pressing open issues will be discussed at the CAC quarterly meeting.
